# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I am an artist who is interested in exploring the relationship between humans and technology.  More specifically, I am interested in what algorithms we create organically that then become digitized and vice versa.  Much of my work incorporates locally-sourced materials, hand- and machine-sewn upcycled / thrifted fabric, improvisational quilting, and generative drawings and watercolor paintings.

My goal on github is to post some of my code and to find some collaborators who would like to take it in different directions.

In the meantime, check out [my Instagram](https://instagram.com/chris.mercerhill) to see what I'm working on.
